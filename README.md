# ⚙️ Run API Server Locally

You’ll need a server (a VPS or local server with public access) to receive the forwarded messages. The API code is included in this repository under the `API` folder.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brahimAbdAlrasol-SS/sms-forwarder
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
cd sms-forwarder/API
```

Install dependencies

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --port 9999 --host 0.0.0.0
```

Congrats! You have now the API on your own server!
Now, we need to setup the [Android APP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frzinapps.smsforward&pli=1) to make it runs with the **API**.
